This is a modification of the excellent Software Defined Radio software by John Melton.  The original sources are in an svn repo revision 1999. See:

http://openhpsdr.org/wiki/index.php?title=Ghpsdr3

The changes are in trunk/src/: 

softrock     - added an IF offset of 9khz (ala PSDR-IQ).  Works with all softrocks.
dspserver    - added IF offset of 9khz.  More robust audio and spectrum transfers.
server       - hpsdr protocol with full control of sdr-widget/Mobo/SR.  Only for sdr-widget.
receiver     - Makefile modified to compile in x86_64, changed local-audio to direct alsa output, changed portaudio to use callback.
               To run under Ubuntu with pulseaudio:  $ ./ghpsdr --local-audio 1 --audio-device pulse
QtRadio      - added dialog to store server ip addresses.  Fixed high cpu util bug.  Implemented 16 bit PCM audio.  See below for
               codec2 encoding and decoding.

There are two branches, master and new-qt.

The master and aconf branches use the 'old' QtMultimedia directory structure.
The new-qt branch uses the QtMobility diectory structure which will be used in
the upcoming new version of Qt.

Note you will need some dev packages to be installed for using Qt
(used by QtRadio), including (Ubuntu/Debian naming convention):

libqt4-opengl-dev
glutg3-dev
libusb-0.1-4
libfftw3-dev
portaudio19-dev
libpulse-dev
libusb-0.1-4

To run the softrock server (defaults to using pulse for IQ input.  So 
use pulse chooser to set the default pulse source to the IQ sound 
card):

cd ~/ghpsdr3-alex/trunk/bin 
./softrock --si570 --iq --samplerate 48000|96000|192000

To run the dspserver: 
cd ~/ghpsdr3-alex/trunk/bin 
./dspserver 

Then you can run QtRadio to connect to the dspserver that is running. 

As an alternative to softrock server, you can use the modified 
"server", which has been customized to connect to the sdr-widget using 
the hpsdr protocol.  You need to setup sdr-widget for the hpsdr 
protocol (with the WidgetControl.py tool), and then run server: 

cd ~/ghpsdr3-alex/trunk/bin 
./server --si570 --receivers 1 --samplerate 48000|96000|192000

After that, you start dspserver (to connect to this server) and 
QtRadio etc. 


QtRadio with codec2 low bit rate audio encoding and decoding
============================================================
We are adding a low bit rate audio codec called codec 2 to QtRadio/dspserver.  You need
to download and build the codec2 library.  See:

http://www.rowetel.com/blog/?page_id=452

$ svn co https://freetel.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/freetel/codec2
$ cd codec2
$ vi src/Makefile.am +87 # append /include to the line #87
$ autoreconf -i
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install
$ sudo ldconfig

Compiling with clang instead of default gcc
===========================================
I have modified the Makefile of server, softrock and dspserver to use clang if you do:

$ make CC=clang

Otherwise it will use the default gcc

I have not figured out how to tell QtCreator to use clang yet.  Right now I can build QtRadio
with clang by hand modifying the Makefile generated by qmake.

The one big advantage of clang over gcc is the more meaningful error/warning messages and other
options to help with debugging.


Autotools building system
=========================
An attempt to create a 'standard' building system.
This branch is experimental and could not generate the right binaries.
Signal bugs and issues to andrew att montefusco dott com.

Please note that in order to use the building system, you need to install GNU autoconf, automake 
and libtool packages.

sudo apt-get install autoconf automake autotools-dev libtool

Next extract the aconf branch from repository and run autoreconf.

cd
git clone git@github.com:alexlee188/ghpsdr3-alex.git ghpsdr3-aconf
cd aconf
git checkout aconf
autoreconf -i

Now you are ready to run, as usual, 

./configure 
make
sudo make install

In order to release a package as tarball:

make distcheck
make dist

Please note that, if you don't want pollute your git sandbox, you can build standing on a 
different unrelated directory the whole thing.

In order to clean up the sandbox, there exists a convenience script that quickly
clean the sandbox:

cd ~/aconf
make clean
sh cleanup.sh
